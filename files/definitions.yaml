attributes:
  description:
    The declaration of all named attributes in the table, including a specification of the primary keys.  For this dictionary, the keys are the attribute names, and the values are tuples that describe the data type and, optionally, the key type. For index key attributes, their data type is declared here, but their key type is defined in the index declaration.

throughput:
  description: >
