  description: The name of the DynamoDB table or index.

preset:
  description: >
    The name of a preset offered by this mixin, a high-level specification of a DynamoDB table configuration, sparing you from repeating low-level instrctions.  If you set this field, all other configuration is overridden for this table.

    graph: A table and GSI configuration supporting a model including vertices, edges, 1st order traversals, and conditional support for higher order traversals.

  type: string
  enum:
    - graph

attributes:
  description:
    The declaration of all named attributes in the table, including a specification of the primary keys.  For this dictionary, the keys are the attribute names, and the values are tuples that describe the data type and, optionally, the key type. For index key attributes, their data type is declared here, but their key type is defined in the index declaration.

    The declaration of keys for this index.  For this dictionary, the keys are the key names, and the values are key type.

throughput:
  description: >
    The maximum amount of capacity that an application can consume from a table or index. For provisioned writes, this is represented in the tuple as [read, write] "units".  If your application exceeds your provisioned throughput settings, it is subject to request throttling. ON-DEMAND mode bills you per request. When in this mode, do not specify throughput on your GSIs.

projection:
  description: >
    Attributes that are copied (projected) from the source table into the index. These attributes are in addition to the primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are automatically projected.  If you omit this field, Sky defaults to the projection ALL.
